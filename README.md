# React boilerplate with MobX
This is a basic react boilerplate that contains: webpack, babel, mobx, react (surprise!), sass and other things that I'm probably forgetting. :)

## How to run

First, install all the project depencies by running: `npm i` or if you are a yarn fan like me `yarn`.

In order to run webpack-dev-server on port 6090 you need to execute: `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`.

## TODO:
- [x] Implement sass
- [ ] Add router store
- [ ] Convert this basic timer into a pomodoro timer
- [ ] Make webpack more efficient by separing the app's code from the vendors' code.
- [ ] Implement at least one model to be used as example (probably a thing to store the pomodoro thing historic)
