# react-mobx-typescript-boilerplate
This is a basic react boilerplate made by using: webpack, babel, mobx, react (surprise!), sass and other things that I'm probably forgetting. :p

TODO:
- [x] Implement sass
- [ ] Add router store
- [ ] Convert this basic timer into a pomodoro timer
- [ ] Make webpack more efficient by separing the app's code from the vendors' code.
- [ ] Implement at least one model to be used as example (probably a thing to store the history of the pomodoro thing)
